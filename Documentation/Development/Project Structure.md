# Project Structure

This repository contains two Projects:
1. CourseSchedulingSystem
2. CourseSchedulingSystem.Tests

## CourseSchedulingSystem
This Project is the main [ASP.NET Core web application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=windows). It also provides a CLI to migrate the database,
seed the database, add users to the system.

### Directory Structure
#### Program.cs
This is the main entrypoint to the application. Commands for the Command Line Interface (CLI) are registered on this class.

#### Startup.cs
This class contains the methods that are run when starting the web server. Additional documentation
can be found here: [App startup in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/startup?view=aspnetcore-2.2)

#### /Areas
[Areas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas?view=aspnetcore-2.2) are
an ASP.NET feature used to partition ASP.NET Core Web apps into smaller functional groups.
Since the project consists of only the admin panel, the only Area is the one for
[ASP.NET Core Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio).

#### /Commands
This directory contains commands for the CLI interface. Commands are implemented using the
[CommandLineUtils](https://natemcmaster.github.io/CommandLineUtils/index.html) library.

#### /Data
The data directory contains the `ApplicationDbContext` which provides data access to the database
and is a representation of the database.

1. */Migrations* - The migrations directory contains the classes used to migrate the database. These files
are generated by Entity Framework Core.
2. */Models* - This directory contains all the database models. These models are representations of
database tables.
3. */Seeders* - This directory contains database seeders. These seeders can be run using the CLI.

#### /Filters
This directory contains [ASP.NET Core Filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/filter?view=aspnetcore-2.2#implement-a-filter-attribute).

#### /Pages
This application uses [ASP.NET Core Razor Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio).
Each `.cshtml` template contains the `@page` directive which binds the page to its corresponding route. Pages
can be additionally bound to a `PageModel` which can contain additional logic that is executed when the
page is activated.

#### /Resources
This directory contains files that should be copied to the output build directory. Files should
have **Build Action** set to **None**, and **Copy to Output Directory** set to **Copy always**.

#### /Services
This directory contains additional services that can be registered in the `Startup.ConfigureServices` method.
Services should be registered and used via [Dependency Injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.2).

#### /Utilities
This directory contains miscellaneous classes, including class extensions.
