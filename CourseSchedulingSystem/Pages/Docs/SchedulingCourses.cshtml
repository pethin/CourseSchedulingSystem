        Finally, select the instructor and the room. Each of these variables has a list currently available variants to choose from. Usually one instructor and one room, though there can be exceptions.

        Atypical scheduling should be consulted on a class per class basis. For instance, lab classes typically only meet one day a week, but have extended hours each meeting. Many single credit courses only meet for 50 minutes twice a week.

        The room based calendar view shows conflicts by room, time, and day. If a space on the calendar is occupied by more than one course, as demonstrated above, then there is a scheduling conflict.
