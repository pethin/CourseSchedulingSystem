    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This manual is included with the software to ease the burden of training new users. It also provides a brief overview of how the software operates, and how the various elements interact with one another.</p>

    <p>The schedule making software relies on an SQL database, which stores all variables and scheduling items in tables. This means that any classes or buildings added by users are not stored locally, and are available to all users after their creation.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Some of the variables are codependent, and require one or more attributes to exist before they may be committed to the database. For instance, a course MUST have a subject variable upon creation.</p>
